## Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

### Current Projects ðŸ”­

Iâ€™m currently working on a couple of personal project. The first one is my website [sunbro.dev](https://sunbro.dev) based on Hugo, and the second one is Chipmunk, a CHIP-8 emulator written in Nim. Most of my projects are over on GitLab, but I mirror the interesting ones here. My current coursework includes a full-stack web application written in React/Redux & Django using Unity to promote learning and a mobile app written in Flutter to make user interfaces more intuitive.

### Currently Learning ðŸŒ±

Iâ€™m currently learning Nim and Flutter thanks to the projects mentioned above, but I'm always looking ahead and plan to learn Gameboy assembly and sharpen up my C++ and C# skills. I try to give back to the FOSS community and contribute whenever I can to projects I use.

### Contacting me ðŸ“«

You can reach me by email at [q.barbarat+github[at]gmail[dot]com](mailto:q.barbarat+github@gmail.com), or directly via an issue on one of my projects.
